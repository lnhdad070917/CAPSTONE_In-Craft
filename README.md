# CAPSTONE_In-Craft

Humankind has gained a great deal of flexibility because of inorganic waste. On the other hand, inorganic waste has created new difficulties for waste management. Inorganic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose, creating unsightly and potentially hazardous accumulations in the environment. The products made using inorganic items have improved daily life's comfort and ease. However, inorganic wastes do not break down over time and have a longer-lasting impact on both people and the environment as a whole. Additionally, inorganic waste pollution can result in the release of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, which can harm plant and animal life. Usually, most people throw away inorganic items without thinking that it can be made into something more useful. With our app, we hope we can address the problem of reducing the amount of unused inorganic waste. Here, the users can easily recycle their trash into a great and creative hand craft and get the tutorial of it. The tutorials are displayed in the form of text, images, and even videos that make it easy for users to create them. Users can access our app via mobile devices. Then, users have to login with their account and scan the trash. The app will display the classification of the inorganic wastes (such as bottle, straw, styrofoam, etc.) and then the users have the options of several crafts along with its tutorial that they can make with the trash they scanned.

## Building Machine Learning Model

1. Determining the categories of inorganic waste: The first step involves identifying and classifying different types of inorganic waste, such as plastics, metals, glass, and other common materials found in waste.

2. Creating and annotating a dataset: Next, a dataset is generated by gathering relevant data for each waste category. This includes images, descriptions, or other pertinent information, which are labeled accordingly to train the machine learning model.

3. Balancing the dataset: It's important to ensure the dataset is balanced, meaning each waste category has an equal number of samples. Adjustments are made to ensure fairness and avoid bias during model training.

4. Collecting YouTube videos that align with the dataset: Additional handcrafted videos demonstrating waste sorting and disposal techniques can be collected from YouTube. These videos provide visual examples that improve the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning model.

5. Extracting materials and steps from the videos: The collected videos are analyzed to identify the materials and steps involved in waste sorting. This information is compiled into a comprehensive guide for waste classification and disposal.

6. Developing a machine learning model: Using the labeled dataset, a machine learning model is built. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, and training the model using the labeled data.

7. Training and validating the model for optimal accuracy: The model is trained iteratively, adjusting its parameters and evaluating its performance. Training continues until the desired accuracy is achieved or further improvements become negligible. Validation is conducted using a separate portion of the dataset to assess the model's ability to generalize and avoid overfitting.

8. Saving the model in SavedModel format: Once trained and validated, the model is saved in the SavedModel format. This standardized format stores the model's architecture, weights, and other necessary information, making it easy to deploy and use for future tasks, such as classifying new instances of inorganic waste.

## Building Android Application

1. To begin, open the Android Studio application on your computer. Once launched, navigate to the menu bar and locate the "File" option. Click on it, and from the dropdown menu, select "New," followed by "Project From Version Control."

2. In order to import the desired project from GitHub, retrieve the GitHub repository's URL, which should be in the format https://github.com/lnhdad070917/CAPSTONE_In-Craft.git. Copy the provided GitHub URL, then return to Android Studio. Within the "New Project From Version Control" window, find the designated field and paste the GitHub URL you just copied. Additionally, choose the directory where you wish to save this project on your local machine.

3. After successfully completing the previous step, you should now have the project directory imported into Android Studio. Navigate to the location where you saved the project from GitHub, then open the corresponding directory within Android Studio. At this point, Android Studio will automatically initiate the process of building the Gradle files, streamlining the setup procedure and configuring the necessary dependencies for your project.

4. Once the Gradle build process concludes, indicating that all the required dependencies have been successfully resolved, you can proceed to the next step. Locate the "Run app" button within Android Studio's interface and click on it. This action will trigger the execution of your Android application, allowing you to see your project in action and interact with its features and functionality.

5. In order to generate the APK file for your Android application, follow these instructions carefully. First, direct your attention to the top panel within Android Studio's interface. There, you will find a series of options and menus designed to assist you in various stages of development. Locate the "Build" option in the top panel and click on it. From the dropdown menu, select "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)," and then choose the "Build APK(s)" option. By taking these steps, Android Studio will initiate the process of compiling your application's source code and resources into a self-contained APK file, which can be subsequently installed and run on Android devices.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 
```
https://github.com/lnhdad070917/CAPSTONE_In-Craft.git
```
2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```
3. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

4. Obtain the service account key from Firebase and save it as '**serviceAccountKey.json**' in the root directory of the application.

5. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your computer.

6. Install the Python dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
___
## Usage

1. Run the application with the following command:
```
node server.js
``` 
The application will run on http://localhost:5000.

2. Upload an image using the '**/upload**' endpoint with the '**POST**' method. You can use Postman or similar applications to send the request. Make sure you include the image as a file using the '**image**' key in form-data.

3. The application will upload the image to Firebase Storage, compress the image, and perform prediction using the Python model.

4. You can access the prediction results and image data through the '**/upload**' endpoint with the '**POST**' method. The prediction result will be sent in the response.

5. You can also use other endpoints such as '**/jenis**' to get data from the "Jenis" collection in Firestore, or '**/jenis/:id**' to get specific jenis data based on the ID.

## Deployment

1. Build your Docker image locally: Ensure that you have Docker installed on your local machine. In the directory where your Dockerfile is located, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t <image-name> .
``` 
Replace <image-name> with a suitable name for your Docker image.
  
2. Tag the Docker image: Before pushing the Docker image to a container registry on GCP, you need to tag it with the registry's URL. GCP provides a container registry called Google Container Registry (GCR). Tag your image using the following command:
```
docker tag <image-name> gcr.io/<project-id>/<image-name>
``` 
Replace <project-id> with your GCP project ID, and <image-name> with the same name you used in step 1.
  
3. Push the Docker image to GCR: To push the Docker image to GCR, run the following command:
```
docker push gcr.io/<project-id>/<image-name>
```
This command will upload your Docker image to the container registry associated with your GCP project.

4. Deploy the Docker container: Once your Docker image is in the GCR, you can deploy it to GCP. There are multiple options available depending on your use case. Here, we'll use Cloud Run to deploy the container. Run the following command to deploy the container:
```
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/<project-id>/<image-name> --platform managed
```
