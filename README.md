# CAPSTONE_In-Craft

Humankind has gained a great deal of flexibility because of inorganic waste. On the other hand, inorganic waste has created new difficulties for waste management. Inorganic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose, creating unsightly and potentially hazardous accumulations in the environment. The products made using inorganic items have improved daily life's comfort and ease. However, inorganic wastes do not break down over time and have a longer-lasting impact on both people and the environment as a whole. Additionally, inorganic waste pollution can result in the release of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, which can harm plant and animal life. Usually, most people throw away inorganic items without thinking that it can be made into something more useful. With our app, we hope we can address the problem of reducing the amount of unused inorganic waste. Here, the users can easily recycle their trash into a great and creative hand craft and get the tutorial of it. The tutorials are displayed in the form of text, images, and even videos that make it easy for users to create them. Users can access our app via mobile devices. Then, users have to login with their account and scan the trash. The app will display the classification of the inorganic wastes (such as bottle, straw, styrofoam, etc.) and then the users have the options of several crafts along with its tutorial that they can make with the trash they scanned.
