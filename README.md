# CAPSTONE_In-Craft


Humankind has gained a great deal of flexibility because of inorganic waste. On the other hand, inorganic waste has created new difficulties for waste management. Inorganic waste can take hundreds of years to decompose, creating unsightly and potentially hazardous accumulations in the environment. The products made using inorganic items have improved daily life's comfort and ease. However, inorganic wastes do not break down over time and have a longer-lasting impact on both people and the environment as a whole. Additionally, inorganic waste pollution can result in the release of toxic chemicals into the soil and water, which can harm plant and animal life. Usually, most people throw away inorganic items without thinking that it can be made into something more useful. With our app, we hope we can address the problem of reducing the amount of unused inorganic waste. Here, the users can easily recycle their trash into a great and creative hand craft and get the tutorial of it. The tutorials are displayed in the form of text, images, and even videos that make it easy for users to create them. Users can access our app via mobile devices. Then, users have to login with their account and scan the trash. The app will display the classification of the inorganic wastes (such as bottle, straw, styrofoam, etc.) and then the users have the options of several crafts along with its tutorial that they can make with the trash they scanned.

## Building Android Application

1. To begin, open the Android Studio application on your computer. Once launched, navigate to the menu bar and locate the "File" option. Click on it, and from the dropdown menu, select "New," followed by "Project From Version Control."

2. In order to import the desired project from GitHub, retrieve the GitHub repository's URL, which should be in the format "https://github.com/rendiano12/CAPSTONE_Inorganic_Waste_Crafting_App.git". Copy the provided GitHub URL, then return to Android Studio. Within the "New Project From Version Control" window, find the designated field and paste the GitHub URL you just copied. Additionally, choose the directory where you wish to save this project on your local machine.

3. After successfully completing the previous step, you should now have the project directory imported into Android Studio. Navigate to the location where you saved the project from GitHub, then open the corresponding directory within Android Studio. At this point, Android Studio will automatically initiate the process of building the Gradle files, streamlining the setup procedure and configuring the necessary dependencies for your project.

4. Once the Gradle build process concludes, indicating that all the required dependencies have been successfully resolved, you can proceed to the next step. Locate the "Run app" button within Android Studio's interface and click on it. This action will trigger the execution of your Android application, allowing you to see your project in action and interact with its features and functionality.

5. In order to generate the APK file for your Android application, follow these instructions carefully. First, direct your attention to the top panel within Android Studio's interface. There, you will find a series of options and menus designed to assist you in various stages of development. Locate the "Build" option in the top panel and click on it. From the dropdown menu, select "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)," and then choose the "Build APK(s)" option. By taking these steps, Android Studio will initiate the process of compiling your application's source code and resources into a self-contained APK file, which can be subsequently installed and run on Android devices.
